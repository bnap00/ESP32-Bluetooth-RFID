# RFID-Scanner

*For Some reason I was not able to get [Original Repo](https://github.com/MariusVB/ESP32-Bluetooth-RFID) to work with my ESP32 varient. So I repurposed the code from original repo and used refrences from [this tutorial](https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-rfid-nfc) to create a SPI based project I2C based project*

Project to utilize an RFC522 RFID Scanner with an ESP32 to act as a Bluetooth RFID Scanner. Set up as a PlatformIO project.

Thanks to @T-vk for the [ESP32-BLE-Keyboard library](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard)

Thanks to @semaf for the [MFRC522 I2C Library](https://github.com/semaf/MFRC522_I2C_Library) *(Not using this library anymore, but hey, keepup the good work)*
